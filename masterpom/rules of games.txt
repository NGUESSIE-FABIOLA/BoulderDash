rules of the game:

score update at each diamond
Enemies follow the right wall
If the Enemies are within one square of the character they will go on him.
If one enemy meets another enemy, they treat each other like walls...
If a rock falls on the character he dies...
If an enemy touches the character, he dies.

	physics of the game:
		if you release a rock/diamond it doesn't move until the character moves AND if there's a stack of 2 the character is not crushed.
		at the moment when the person moves the gravity applies on them, they update to all the ticks of the clock.
		if a moving element is on top of another and has the possibility to fall to its right or left, it will go in the direction of its last horizontal movement (~conservation of momentum), if it does not have a random direction
